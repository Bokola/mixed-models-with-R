This folder contains all you need to get started with the Mixed Model workshop.  It contains the following:

- data/: Data folder containing *.RData files that contain the data used in examples and/or exercises.
- starter.R: A starter script to get you going with the examples used in the document.

Click on the blue mixed_model_workshop_files.Rproj to open this project in RStudio. 

Open the slim_review.Rmd file. We'll first get our bearings from yesterday by doing a brief review.

Once we're done with that, open the starter script, and you're all set for the remainder of the workshop.

# Introduction

## Overview

Mixed models are an extremely useful modeling tool for clustered data situations. It is quite common to have data in which we have repeated measurements for the units of observation, or in which the units of observation are otherwise clustered (e.g. students within school, cities within geographic region).   While there are different ways to approach such a situation, mixed models are far and away the most common approach.

### Goals

To provide a sense of when one would use mixed models and the variety of techniques available.  Additionally, we'll have exercises to practice the technique.

## Terminology

Mixed models can deal with such data in a variety of ways, but for the uninitiated, the terminology, especially across disciplines, can be a bit daunting.

Some terms you might come across regarding mixed models:

- Variance components
- Random intercepts and slopes
- Random effects
- Random coefficients
- Varying coefficients
- Intercepts and slopes-as-outcomes
- Hierarchical linear models
- Multilevel models (implies multiple levels of hierarchically clustered data)
- Growth curve models (possibly Latent GCM)
- Mixed effects models

All describe types of mixed models.  Some might be more historical, others are more often seen in a specific discipline, others might refer to a certain data structure (e.g. multilevel clustering), and still others are special cases. <span class='emph'>Mixed effects</span>, or simply mixed, models generally refer to a mixture of fixed and random effects.  I prefer the term mixed models because it is simple and no specific structure is implied[^mixmeth].  <span class='emph'>Fixed effects</span>, is perhaps a poor but nonetheless stubborn term for the typical main effects one would see in a linear regression model, i.e. the non-random part of a mixed model, and in some contexts they are referred to as the *population average* effect.


### Kinds of clustering

Data might have one or multiple sources of clustering, and that clustering may be hierarchical, such that clusters are nested within other clusters. An example would be scholastic aptitude tests given multiple times to students (repeated observations nested within students, students nested within schools, schools nested within districts). In other cases, there is no nesting structure. An example would be a reaction time experiment where participants perform the same set of tasks.  While observations are nested within individual, observations are also clustered according to task type.  Some use the terms neste

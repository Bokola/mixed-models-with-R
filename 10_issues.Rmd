# Issues


## Alternative approaches

Alternative approaches used in clustered data situations include:

- Using cluster-robust standard errors
- Fixed effects models (also panel linear models with fixed, as opposed to random, effects)
- Generalized estimating equations

The first two are commonly used by those trained with an econometrics perspective, while you might see GEE more with those of a biostatistics perspective. 


### Growth curve models


## Sample sizes

### Small number of clusters

Hard to estimate variance with small nclus

### Small N within cluster

Mixed models work even with no more than two and some singletons


### Balanced/Missing values




## Crossed vs. Nested


## GLMM and beyond

This will be the Rstudio project folder you'll use for the workshop.  Just click
on the blue icon to get started.

All data necessary is in the data folder as *.RData files.  You can access the
data in your scripts via `load('data/file.Rdata')`

There is one script that can get you started with the GPA data example.  Beyond
that, you can copy/paste any of the code you see as we go along.

Data from center for Multilevel Modeling website: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/learning/support/datasets/


This data library is designed for purposes of teaching and training in the application of multilevel models. Any publication related to using datasets from the library should acknowledge the Centre for Multilevel Modelling and the original source where specified.

Each dataset has three files associated with it which have been compressed into one zipped file. There is a text file describing the data, an ASCII file with the raw data and a worksheet file.

The data contained in the zip files below are held in .dat (basic text file), .ws, and .asc formats

- .ws is an MLwiN worksheet. If you have MLwiN you can open this file.
- Stata, SPSS or Minitab users can use MLwiN to save the file in any of these formats
- .asc is fixed width ASCII text. The data is held in the .DAT file and is described in the .ASC file. To read this version into Stata you will need to use the infix command (for further details go to Stata's help for infix) while referring to the .ASC file. An example command for reading the asian data set would be:
- infix ChildID 1-4 Age 5-7 Weight 8-12 BirthWeight 13-16 Gender 17 using asian.dat

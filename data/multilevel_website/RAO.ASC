     The data consist of jaw bone length measurements (in mm) from 20 boys.
They were measured on four fixed occasions, at ages 8, 8.5, 9, and 9.5 years.
The format is as follows:


         Column      Description

         1-4         length at 8 years         in mm

         6-9         length at 8.5 years       in mm

         11-14       length at 9 years         in mm

         16-19       length at 9.5 years       in mm

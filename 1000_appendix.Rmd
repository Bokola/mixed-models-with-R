# Appendix


## Data

Note that I have converted these from their original SPSS format to R data.frames saved within RData files. I also cleaned them up with better names/labels etc. Most of the description is taken from Joop Hox's text appendix.

- <span class="emph">GPA</span>: The GPA data are a longitudinal data set, where 200 college students have been followed 6 consecutive semesters. In this data set, there are GPA measures on 6 consecutive occasions, with a JOB status variable (how many hours worked) for the same 6 occasions. There are two student-level explanatory variables: the gender (1= male, 2= female) and the high school GPA. There is also a dichotomous student-level outcome variable, which indicates whether a student has been admitted to the university of their choice. Since not every student applies to a university, this variable has many missing values. 

- <span class="emph">pupils</span>: Assume that we have data from 1000 pupils who have attended 100 different primary schools, and subsequently went on to 30 secondary schools. Similar to the situation where we have pupils within schools and neighborhoods, we have a cross-classified structure. Pupils are nested within primary and within secondary schools, with primary and secondary schools crossed. In other words: pupils are nested within the cross-classification of primary and secondary schools. In our example, we have a response variable achievement which is measured in secondary school. We have two explanatory variables at the pupil level: pupil gender (0 = male, 1 = female) and a six-point scale for pupil socioeconomic status, pupil ses. We have at the school level a dichotom- ous variable that indicates if the school is public (denom = 0) or denominational (denom = 1). Since we have both primary and secondary schools, we have two such variables (named pdenom for the primary school and sdenom for the secondary school).


- <span class="emph">nurses</span>: The data in this example are from a hypothetical study on stress in hospitals. The data are from nurses working in wards nested within hospitals. In each of 25 hospitals, four wards are selected and randomly assigned to an experimental and control condition. In the experimental condition, a training program is offered to all nurses to cope with job- related stress. After the program is completed, a sample of about 10 nurses from each ward is given a test that measures job-related stress. Additional variables are: nurse age (years), nurse experience (years), nurse gender (0 = male, 1 = female), type of ward (0 = general care, 1 = special care), and hospital size (0 = small, 1 = medium, 2 = large). This is an example of an experiment where the experimental intervention is carried out at the group level. In biomedical research this design is known as a cluster randomized trial. They are quite common also in educational and organizational research, where entire classes or schools are assigned to experimental and control conditions. Since the design variable Experimental versus Control group (ExpCon) is manipulated at the second (ward) level, we can study whether the experimental effect is different in different hospitals, by defining the regression coefficient for the ExpCon variable as random at the hospital level. In this example, the variable ExpCon is of main interest, and the other variables are covariates. Their function is to control for differences between the groups, which should be small given that randomization is used, and to explain variance in the outcome variable stress. To the extent that they are successful in explaining variance, the power of the test for the effect of ExpCon will be increased. Therefore, although logically we can test if explanatory variables at the first level have random coefficients at the second or third level, and if explanatory variables at the second level have random coefficients at the third level, these possibilities are not pursued. We do test a model with a random coefficient for ExpCon at the third level, where there turns out to be significant slope variation. This varying slope can be predicted by adding a cross-level interaction between the variables ExpCon and HospSize. In view of this interaction, the variables ExpCon and HospSize have been centered on their overall mean. 



## Programming languages

R has more mixed modeling capabilities than anything else out there.  However there are other options.

- <span class="pack">lme4</span>: generalized linear mixed models; extremely efficient
- <span class="pack">nlme</span>: non-linear mixed models but only for the gaussian case.
- <span class="pack">mgcv</span>: provides means to use both lme4 or nlme, extends distributional families, correlated residuals, and all that additive model stuff too
- <span class="pack">rstanarm</span>:  Bayesian with lme4 level options
- <span class="pack">brms</span>: Bayesian with possibly the most extensive mixed model capabilities
- <span class="pack">ordinal</span>: for various types of ordinal models



- Python: the [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/mixed_linear.html) module has basic capabilities for mixed models but not too many frills (e.g. no crossed random effects).
- Julia: one of the <span class="pack">lme4</span> authors develops a [MixedModels](https://github.com/dmbates/MixedModels.jl) package for Julia

### Proprietary

Among the standard stats packages, I can only recommend Stata for both ease of implementation and flexiblity in modeling. SAS and SPSS both have non-intuitive and needlessly verbose syntax, and, while SAS is a fairly good tool for mixed models (from my understanding), I've seen SPSS consistently struggle with even simple models.  

Mplus has a lot of functionality both for standard mixed models and growth curve models, though between <span class="pack">lavaan</span>, <span class="pack">mediation</span>, and the rest of R, there is little need to use Mplus except for very complicated multilevel SEM, which requires very large samples and a lot of theoretical justification.

I will also say that there is zero reason to use mixed model specfic software like HLM.  The days for such hijinks have long since passed.
